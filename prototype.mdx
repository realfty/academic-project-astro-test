## Abstract

The **network approach** to characterizing psychopathology departs from traditional latent categorical and dimensional approaches. Causal interplay among symptoms contributed to dynamic psychopathology system. Therefore, analyzing the symptom clusters is critical for understanding mental disorders. Furthermore, despite extensive research studying the topological features of symptom networks, the control relationships between symptoms remain largely unclear. Here, we present a novel systematizing concept, <SmallCaps>module control</SmallCaps>, to analyze the control principle of the symptom network at a module level. We introduce **Module Control Network (MCN)** to identify key modules that regulate the network's behavior. By applying our approach to a multivariate psychological dataset, we discover that *non-emotional modules*, such as sleep-related and stress-related modules, are the primary controlling modules in the symptom network. Our ﬁndings indicate that <SmallCaps>module control</SmallCaps> can expose central symptom cluster governing psychopathology network, offering novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of mental disorders and individualized approach to psychological interventions.

## Graphical abstract

This figure illustrates the main concepts and findings of our research on module control in network systems for psychopathology.

<Figure

  <Image src={moduleControlOverview} alt="Diagram showing module control network concepts, non-emotional modules as main control modules, and stability analysis" />
</Figure>

The figure is divided into three main sections:

1. **A Novel Concept for the Module Control of Network System**: This section demonstrates how a network with module structure is transformed into a module control network, and then analyzed for module control frequency.

2. **The Non-emotional Module as the Main Control Module for Participants**: This part shows that non-emotional modules, particularly sleep-related modules (SRM) and stress-related modules (PSM, NSM), exhibit strong control powers over other modules in the symptom network. Four scales were included in the symptom network: PHQ, ISI, GAD, and PSS.

3. **Stability Analysis Verified the Validity of the Results**: The final section illustrates the stability analysis process, where 80% of the data was sampled and repeated 1,000 times to construct networks, calculate module control powers, and analyze stability.

This visual representation encapsulates the core methodology and findings of our research on module control in psychopathology networks.

## Results

### Module Control Network Analysis

Our analysis of the Module Control Network (MCN) revealed several key findings:

1. **Non-emotional modules as primary controllers**: The non-emotional modules, particularly the sleep-related module (SRM) and stress-related modules (PSM, NSM), exhibited the strongest control powers over other modules in the symptom network.

2. **Module control powers**: The average module control powers for each module were:
   - SRM (Sleep-Related Module): 0.410
   - PSM (Positive Stress Module): 0.283
   - NSM (Negative Stress Module): 0.281
   - DRM (Depression-Related Module): 0.222
   - ARM (Anxiety-Related Module): 0.199
   - SUM (Suicide-Related Module): 0.106

  <Image src={mcnAnalysis} alt="Module Control Network analysis results showing connections and control powers between modules" />
</Figure>

3. **Hierarchical structure**: The MCN analysis uncovered a hierarchical structure in the symptom network, with non-emotional modules at the top of the hierarchy, followed by emotional modules.

4. **Inter-module connections**: Strong connections were observed between:
   - SRM and PSM (weight: 0.40)
   - PSM and NSM (weight: 0.35)
   - ARM and DRM (weight: 0.34)

5. **Intra-module connections**: The analysis revealed significant intra-module connections, particularly within the SRM, PSM, and NSM modules.

### Stability Analysis

To verify the validity of our results, we conducted a comprehensive stability analysis:

1. **Sampling procedure**: We randomly sampled 80% of the original dataset and repeated the network construction and module control power calculation 1,000 times.

2. **Consistency of results**: The stability analysis confirmed the robustness of our findings:
   - The hierarchical structure of the MCN remained consistent across samples.
   - Non-emotional modules (SRM, PSM, NSM) consistently showed the highest control powers.

<Figure
  caption="Figure 4: Stability Analysis Results"

  <Image src={stabilityAnalysis} alt="Stability analysis results showing the distribution of module control powers across 1,000 samples" />
</Figure>

3. **Statistical significance**: The differences in module control powers between non-emotional and emotional modules were statistically significant (p < 0.001).

4. **Correlation with clinical measures**: We found significant correlations between module control powers and clinical severity measures:
   - SRM control power correlated with sleep quality (r = -0.42, p < 0.001)
   - PSM control power correlated with perceived stress levels (r = 0.38, p < 0.001)

These results demonstrate the robustness of our Module Control Network approach and highlight the importance of non-emotional symptoms in the overall structure of psychopathology networks.

## Discussion

Our study introduces a novel module control approach to understanding psychopathology networks, yielding significant insights:

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: 
   We uncovered a hierarchical structure in psychopathology networks, with non-emotional modules (sleep and stress-related) exerting stronger control over the system. This challenges traditional views that often prioritize emotional symptoms in mental disorders.

2. **Clinical Implications**: 
   - Targeting non-emotional symptoms, particularly sleep and stress-related issues, might be more effective in treating mental disorders.
   - This approach allows for more personalized treatment strategies based on individual symptom profiles.
   - Interventions aimed at improving sleep quality and stress management could be crucial in preventing mental health disorders.

3. **Limitations and Future Directions**: 
   - Our cross-sectional data limits causal inferences. Longitudinal studies are needed.
   - Future research should focus on validating this approach across diverse populations and exploring its predictive power over time.

In conclusion, our module control network approach offers a new perspective on psychopathology, potentially impacting both theoretical models and clinical practices in mental health.

## Two columns

Use the two columns component to display two columns of content. In this example, the first column contains a figure with a YouTube video and the second column contains a figure with a custom [React](https://react.dev/) component. By default, they display side by side, but if the screen is narrow enough (for example, on mobile), they're arranged vertically.
